As you work for your assigned company (Church Inc. or Turing Co.), you will be coding and upgrading your very
own MOB-BOT. MOB-BOT is a friendly, cute, and efficient robot designed to mine in The Quarry forever! How lovely.

Here are some important notes about MOB-BOT that will help you to improve its functionalities.


Tech Tree
---------

MOB-BOT can undergo a myriad of upgrades that will make it an amazing, mining machine. This tree structure shows
the available upgrade paths and how you can improve.

Here's a description of all the techs. The order goes by row as depicted above:

========================================================== =============================================================
Tech Name                                                  Tech Description
========================================================== =============================================================
Better Drivetrain |bdt|                                   This tech will increase your movement, allowing MOB-BOT to
                                                           **move up to 2 tiles per turn**!

Unnamed Drivetrain Tech |udt|                              Grants an additional movement, allowing MOB-BOT to **move**
                                                           **up to 3 tiles per turn**! How wonderful!

Overdrive Movement |om|                                    The ultimate movement upgrade. MOB-BOT can now **move up to**
                                                           **4 tiles per turn**! Burn rubber!

High Yield Mining |hym|                                    A decent upgrade from your basic Mining Robotics. MOB-BOT
                                                           will now **gain 2 pieces of ore** when you mine!

Unnamed Mining Tech |umt|                                  This mysterious new tech brings MOB-BOT's efficiency to a new
                                                           level. MOB-BOT will **gain 3 pieces of ore** when mining!
                                                           Sensational!

Overdrive Mining |omining|                                 MOB-BOT has become the mining machine it was always meant to
                                                           be. MOB-BOT will now **gain 4 pieces of ore** per turn!
                                                           Bring in the money!

Dynamite |dyn|                                             Become more efficient with your mining! Dynamite will explode
                                                           **3 turns** after being placed, mining multiple ores at once!

Landmines |lm|                                             The other company keeps taking valuable ores, so let's set
                                                           traps for them... `>:D` Landmines will steal ores from the
                                                           opponent when detonated.

EMPs |emp|                                                 EMPs are the rich Bot's landmine! EMPs will steal more from
                                                           the opponent than a normal landmine. Phenomenal!

Defuse |diffuse|                                           Fight back against the traps that are set against you. Trap
                                                           defusing will deactivate any trap placed by the enemy (as
                                                           long as you don't step on it)!
