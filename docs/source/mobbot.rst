Here are some important notes about MOB-BOT that will help you to improve its functionalities.


Tech Tree
---------

MOB-BOT can undergo a myriad of upgrades that will make it an amazing, mining machine. This tree structure shows
the available upgrade paths and how you can improve.

(sprite of tech tree here)

Here's a description of all the techs:

- Mining Robotics
    - A basic tech that every MOB-BOT comes with. It wouldn't be able to mine without basic mining tools, would it?
- Better Drivetrains
    - Grants increased movement during your turn.
- Unnamed Drivetrain Tech
    - Grants more increased movement during your turn.
- Overdrive Movement
    - ?
- High Yield Drilling
    - Drilling makes mining more efficient. This will increase how many pieces of ore you mine from one tile
- Unnamed Mining Tech
    - This secret tech will increase how much ore you gain from one tile even more!
- Overdrive Mining
    - ?
- Dynamite
    - Dynamite will explode after (x) turns after being placed. It will add all surrounding ores to
    your inventory
- Landmines
    - Landmines are useful to steal from the opponent. For every item in the opponent's inventory, there will be a
    10% chance to steal it once activated.
- EMPs
    - EMPs are the better landmine. With a stronger explosion, every item in the opponent's inventory has a 20%
    chance to be stolen once activated.
