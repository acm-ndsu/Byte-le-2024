In order to improve efficiency of mining and optimize the amount of ores your MOB-BOT can mine, there are
different objects that can be placed on the map. These include Dynamite, Landmines, and EMPs.



Dynamite

After unlocking this in your Tech Tree, you will be able to place sticks of dynamite on different tiles. This
is a very valuable upgrade to have in every MOB-BOT!

Mining one ore at a time is cumbersome, so the dynamite solves this issue. Place dynamite on a tile and wait a
few turns. It will explode the four adjacent Tiles and the Tile it's on top of and add the ores that are there
to your inventory. That's 5 ores you collect in one turn, on top of anything else MOB-BOT mines after placing the
dynamite (sensational)!

Let the table below depict a 3x3 game map. 'C' stands for Copium, 'D' for Dynamite, 'L' for Lambium, 'T' for
Turite, and '.' will be an empty space.

This just shows which Tiles the dynamite object affected when it exploded. All the ores that are gone would now
be in your inventory. Hope that helps!


Landmines

Landmines are DANGEROUS! If this is unlocked from the Tech Tree, that MOB-BOT becomes a thieving threat
in The Quarry!

Whenever a landmine is placed by the opposing team, if your MOB-BOT steps on it, every item in your inventory has a
10% chance of being stolen! Be mindful, and watch your step! (Any damage done to MOB-BOT will be paid for in full
by the employee(s) responsible, as stated in the Quarry Rush Employee Contract).

If your MOB-BOT placed a landmine and steps on it, it won't activate, so don't worry. Isn't technology amazing?


EMPs
----

If you thought landmines were bad, EMPs are much worse... by an additional 10% that is.

EMPs act just like landmines. The only difference is that every item has a 20% chance of being stolen from your
inventory. Yikes!

EMPs are the upgraded versions of Landmines. So once a MOB-BOT has EMPs unlocked, they can no longer place
Landmines.
