In order to improve efficiency of mining and optimize the amount of ores your MOB-BOT can mine, there are
different objects that can be placed on the map. These include Dynamite, Landmines, and EMPs.



Dynamite |dynamite|
-------------------

After unlocking this in your Tech Tree, you will be able to place sticks of dynamite on different tiles. This
is a very valuable upgrade to have in every MOB-BOT!

Mining one ore at a time is cumbersome, so the dynamite solves this issue. Place dynamite on a tile and wait a
few turns. It will explode the four adjacent Tiles and the Tile it's on top of and add the ores that are there
to your inventory. That's 5 ores you collect in one turn, on top of anything else MOB-BOT mines after placing the
dynamite (sensational)!

Landmines |landmine|

Landmines are DANGEROUS! If this is unlocked from the Tech Tree, that MOB-BOT becomes a thieving threat
in The Quarry!

Whenever a landmine is placed by the opposing team, if your MOB-BOT steps on it, every item in your inventory has a
10% chance of being stolen! Be mindful, and watch your step! (Any damage done to MOB-BOT will be paid for in full
by the employee(s) responsible, as stated in the Quarry Rush Employee Contract).

If your MOB-BOT placed a landmine and steps on it, it won't activate, so don't worry. Isn't technology amazing?


EMPs |emp|
----------

If you thought landmines were bad, EMPs are much worse... by an additional 10% that is.

EMPs act just like landmines. The only difference is that every item has a 20% chance of being stolen from your
inventory. Yikes!

EMPs are the upgraded versions of Landmines. So once a MOB-BOT has EMPs unlocked, they can no longer place
Landmines.
