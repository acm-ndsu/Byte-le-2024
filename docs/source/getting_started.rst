NOTICE

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

More commands are listed in :doc:`useful_commands`. Thank you!


Objective
---------
Your objective for this year is to mine more ores than the opposing team.

As you collect ores, make your way back to your base to cash them in for total points and upgrade points!
Upgrading your MOB-BOT will increase how much you can mine, thus improving corporate revenue (fantastic)!
You can even disrupt the opposing team with traps, giving you the advantage and removing the competition
from the market (astounding)!

At the end of every round game, the bot with the most points will win. **(UPDATE THIS >>>)** After one game,
both bots will swap teams.

More detail on the MOB-BOT is provided (here).

Remember -- failure to comply with the high standards of the company, along with failure to defeat the rival
company in the task of mining the most ore, will result in ``immediate termination``. But you'll be okay.

Running the Game
================
Python Version
--------------

Make sure to uninstall the visual studio version of python if you have visual studio installed.
You can do this by re-running the installer and unselecting the python development kit then clicking update.

We require using Python version 3.11.

You can use any text editor or IDE for this competition, but we recommend Visual Studio Code.


Getting the Code and MOB-BOT
----------------------------

Need to discuss how we will distribute the code to contestants.
