Getting Started
===============

NOTICE
======

Please run the following command to install the necessary packages to run the game:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

More commands are listed in :doc:`useful_commands`. Thank you!


Objective
=========
Your objective for this year is to gain more points than your opponents. This is done by more mining ores than the
opposing team in The Quarry, and by unlocking upgrades. :doc:`scoring` will explain the point totals of everything.

As you collect ores, make your way back to your base to cash them in for game points and science points!
Upgrading your MOB-BOT with science points will increase its mining capabilities, thus improving corporate revenue
(fantastic)! You can even disrupt the opposing team with traps, giving you the advantage and removing the competition
from the market (astounding)!

Visit :doc:`mobbot` for more information on how it all works.

Remember -- failure to comply with the high standards of the company, along with failure to defeat the rival
company in the task of mining the most ore, will result in ``immediate termination``. But you'll be okay.
``:)``


Tournament Structure
====================
Each pairing of teams will have two games against each other. After one game, both teams will switch company
affiliations (i.e., if first with Church Inc., will next be Turing Co.). The points gained from both games will be added
to those teams' total points in the tournament.


Running the Game

You can do this by re-running the installer and unselecting the python development kit then clicking update.
