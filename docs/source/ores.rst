Ores
====

Ores are crucial in this game. Not only do they support your respective company's goal of monetary gain and ruling
the technological world, but they also increase your points and allow for you to upgrade your MOB-BOT! Here are
the different ores you can mine.


Copium
======

A very basic ore that's a commodity for every MOB-BOT. Everyone wants Copium. Who doesn't want Copium? |pepe copium|

Mining this ore will yield **20** points, regardless of company affiliation.


Lambdium
========

Lambdium is the favored ore by Church Inc. Lambdium is what powers their MOB-BOTs and allows them
to continue research for investigating something called 'anonymous functions,' whatever those are.

If you are affiliated with **Church Inc.**, any Lambdium you mine will yield **80 points**! That's a steal!

If you are affiliated with **Turing Co.**, the Lambdium you mine will be worth **24 points**. It's still
valuable, but it's not what you want. It's (barely) better than Copium, though!


Turite
======

Turite is the favored ore by Turing Inc. Turite will power Turing Machine-based MOB-BOTs and improve their systems to
become more turing complete! Fascinating.

**Turing Co.** will yield **80 points** for every Turite they cash in.

If you are affiliated with **Church Inc.**, Turite will yield **24 points** for you. That's still worthwhile, but again,
it's (barely) better than Copium.


Ancient Tech
============

In The Quarry, there is another strange mineral called Ancient Tech. When refined, its shape is oddly reminiscent of
something from the distant past... |doors logo|

Regardless, Ancient Tech is unique in that it doesn't yield normal points, but science points. The amount of science
points earned is listed in :doc:`scoring`. These points will allow you to upgrade your MOB-BOT. These upgrades include
faster movement speed, placing dynamite, placing traps, and a few other things. Upgrades are explained more in
:doc:`mobbot`.
