Ores are crucial in this game. Not only do they support your respective company's goal of monetary gain and ruling
the technological world, but they also increase your points and allow for you to upgrade your MOB-BOT! Here are
the different ores you can mine.


Copium
======

A very basic ore that's a commodity for every MOB-BOT. Everyone wants :green:`Copium`. Who doesn't want :green:`Copium`?
|pepe copium| Mining this ore will yield :gold:`20 points`, regardless of company affiliation.


Lambdium
========

:blue:`Lambdium` is the favored ore by :blue:`Church Inc.` :blue:`Lambdium` is what powers their MOB-BOTs and allows 
them to continue research for investigating something called 'anonymous functions,' whatever those are.

If you are affiliated with :blue:`Church Inc.`, any :blue:`Lambdium` you mine will yield :gold:`80 points`! That's a
steal!

If you are affiliated with :red:`Turing Co.`, the :blue:`Lambdium` you mine will be worth :gold:`24 points`. It's still
valuable, but it's not what you want. It's (barely) better than :green:`Copium`, though!


Turite
======

:red:`Turite` is the favored ore by Turing Inc. :red:`Turite` will power Turing Machine-based MOB-BOTs and improve their
systems to become more turing complete! Fascinating.

:red:`Turing Co.` will yield :gold:`80 points` for every :red:`Turite` they cash in.

If you are affiliated with :blue:`Church Inc.`, :red:`Turite` will yield :gold:`24 points` for you. That's still
worthwhile, but again, it's (barely) better than :green:`Copium`.


Ancient Tech
============

In The Quarry, there is another strange mineral called :brown:`Ancient Tech`. When refined, its shape is oddly
reminiscent of something from the distant past... |doors logo|

Regardless, :brown:`Ancient Tech` is unique in that it doesn't yield normal points, but science points. The amount of
science points earned is listed in :doc:`scoring`. These points will allow you to upgrade your MOB-BOT. These upgrades
include faster movement speed, placing dynamite, placing traps, and a few other things. Upgrades are explained more in
:doc:`mobbot`.
