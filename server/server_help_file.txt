database.py
-----------

The database file is what's used to create the actual database in the project. The file listed here creates it with
SQLite.


main.py
-------

The main file is what uses FastAPI to create the URLs that utilize the schemas. It also calls methods that create the
database if it hasn't been created yet.

To check if the serve is running, go to the root page. If it says 'Hello World,' congrats! Your server is up and
running. To check this, type the root directory specified by `self.IP` in client_utils.py in your browser. 'Hello World'
should be the only thing printed there.

Typing in the other URLs listed in each method should return the data needed, assuming it's in the database. HTTP errors
are raised if something goes wrong, and these are caught and handled in the client_utils.py file.
