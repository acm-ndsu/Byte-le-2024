Overview
--------

The CRUD module is used to store methods that will be used to Create, Read, Update, and Delete tables in the database.
Each CRUD file is related to its respective table.

Eager Loading
-------------

In a few methods, there is a variable called `eager`. This bool will determine whether the database should return all
information within a table or only the specified information.

For example, in crud_run.py, all 3 'read' methods use eager loading. In the `read()` method, if eager loading is false,
only the most recent run from the table is returned. If eager loading is true, the most recent run is returned, but it
comes with information from the other tables it's also related to: Turns, Tournament, and SubmissionRunInfo.

Commit Method
-------------

In the Create, Update, and Delete methods, they all commonly use `db.commit()`. This method is necessary to save any
changes in the database. Without this, changes will not be reflected, so make sure that it is used in each of these
methods.
