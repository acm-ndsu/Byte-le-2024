The .png files found in this folder are used in the examples classes listed in the bytesprites folder. They represent
the Avatar, Tile, and Wall classes respectively.

For creating sprite, we recommend using paint.net. It's free to use and comes with a lot of handy tools. If there is
different software you prefer using/already have, that is perfectly fine.
