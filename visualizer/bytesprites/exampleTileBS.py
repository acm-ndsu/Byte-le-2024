    This class is used to demonstrate an example of the Tile Bytesprite. It demonstrates how any class inheriting

        This implementation of the update method is different from the exampleWallBS.py file. In this method, the

        For this unique implementation, an if statement is used to check if something is occupying the Tile object.

        Examining the ExampleTileSS.png, it is apparent that the first spritesheet shows a Tile with an animation with
        only the pink color. However, the second spritesheet (the one used if something occupies that tile) has a unique
        animation that is blue instead.
