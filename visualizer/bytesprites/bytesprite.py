    `ByteSprite Class Notes:`

    PyGame Notes
    ------------
    Here are listed definitions of the PyGame objects that are used in this file:
        PyGame.Rect:
            "An object for storing rectangular coordinates." This is used to help position things on the screen.

        PyGame.Surface:
            "An object for representing images." This is used mostly for getting the screen and individual images in
            a spritesheet.


    Class Variables
    ---------------
        Active Sheet:
            The active_sheet is the list of images (sprites) that is currently being used. In other words, it's a strip
            of sprites that will be used.

        Spritesheets:
            This is a 2D array of sprites. For example, refer to the ``ExampleSpritesheet.png`` file. The entirety of the
            4x4 would be a spritesheet. One row of it would be used as an active sheet.

        Object Type:
            This is an int that represents the enum value of the Object the sprite represents. For example, the
            ``ExampleSpritesheet.png`` shows the Avatar. The Avatar object_type's enum value is found in the JSON logs and
            is the number 4. This would change if the order of the ObjectType enum changes, so be mindful of that and
            refer to the JSON logs for the exact values.

        Rect:
            The rect is an object used for rectangular objects. You can offset the top left corner of the Rect by
            passing parameters.

            Example:

            On the left, the Rect's offset is depicted as being at (0, 0),  meaning there is no offset. A Rect object
            has parameters that will determine the offset by passing in (x, y). The 'x' is the offset from the left
            side, and the 'y' is the offset from the top. Therefore, passing in an (x, y) of (3, 2) in a Rect object
            will move the object 3 units to the right, and 2 units down.

            In the visual below, the left side shows a Rect at (0, 0) (i.e., no offset). The image on the right depicts
            the Rect object further to the right, showing its offset from the left corner of the screen.

        Rect Example:
        ::
            -----------------------                 -----------------------
            |------               |                 |     ------          |
            ||    |               |                 |     |    |          |
            |______               |    -------->    |     ______          |
            |                     |                 |                     |
            |                     |                 |                     |
            |                     |                 |                     |
            -----------------------                 -----------------------

        Screen:
            The screen is also a PyGame.Screen object, so it simply represents an image of the screen itself.

        Image:
            The image is an individual sprite in a spritesheet.

        Frame Index:
            The frame index is an int that is used to determine which sprite to use from the active_sheet. For example,
            say the active_sheet is the first row in the ``ExampleSpritesheet.png``. If the frame_index is 1, the first
            image will be used where the head is centered. If the frame_index is 3, the sprite will now have the head of
            the Avatar in a different position than in frame_index 1.

        Config:
            This is an object reference to the ``config.py`` file. It's used to access the fixed values that are only
            accessed in the configurations of the file.

        Update Function:
            The update function is a method that is assigned during instantiation of the ByteSprite. That function is
            used to update what the active_sheet is depending on what is implemented in ByteSprite classes.

            Examine the ``exampleBS.py`` file. In that implementation of the update method, it selects the active_sheet
            based on a chain of if statements. Next, in the ``create_bytesprite`` method, the implemented ``update``
            method is passed into the returned ByteSprite object.

            Now, in the ByteSprite object's update method, it will set the active_sheet to be based on what is returned
            from the BytespriteFactory's method.

            To recap, first, a ByteSprite's update function depends on the BytespriteFactory's implementation. Then, the
            BytespriteFactory's implementation will return which sprite_sheet is supposed to be used. Finally, the
            ByteSprite's update function will take what is returned from the BytespriteFactory's method and assign
            the active_sheet to be what is returned. The two work in tandem.
