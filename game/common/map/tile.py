    `Tile Class Notes:`

        The Tile class exists to encapsulate all objects that could be placed on the gameboard.

        Tiles will represent things like the floor in the game. They inherit from Occupiable, which allows for tiles to
        have certain GameObjects and the avatar on it.

        If the game being developed requires different tiles with special properties, future classes may be added and
        inherit from this class.
