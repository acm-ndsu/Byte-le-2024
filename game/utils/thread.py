        Threads are how the engine communicates with user clients. These Threads are built to catch errors. If an error
        is caught, it will be logged, but the program will continue to run.

        If multithreading is needed for whatever reason, this class would be used for that.

    `Communication Thread Class Notes:`

        Communication Threads are bulkier than normal Threads. It also has error catching functionality, but tends
        to be used for single-use, single-variable communication.

        For example, if a client tries to use malicious code in any methods, a Communication Thread is used to check
        any given parameters and throw an error if the type needed does not match what is given.

        Communication Threads use a nested class to make the return value of the Communication Thread private. It helps
        to keep things secure. This is now achieved through getter and setter decorators. Since the code here was
        written long ago, the structure is different. For future note, use getter and setter decorators as needed.
