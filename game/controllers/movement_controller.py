    `Movement Controller Notes:`

        The Movement Controller manages the movement actions the player tries to execute. Players can move up, down,
        left, and right. If the player tries to move into a space that's impassable, they don't move.

        For example, if the player attempts to move into an Occupiable Station (something the player can be on) that is
        occupied by a Wall object (something the player can't be on), the player doesn't move; that is, if the player
        tries to move into anything that can't be occupied by something, they won't move.
