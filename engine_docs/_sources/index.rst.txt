=============================================
Welcome to NDACM's Byte Engine Documentation!
=============================================

NDSU's ACM chapter hosts an annual competition called "Byte-le Royale." This competition was created by Riley Conlin,
Jordan Goetze, Jacob Baumann, Ajay Brown, and Nick Hilger. It promotes working with others and developing critical
thinking skills, while challenging competitors under a time limit.

This project provides the framework for developing games for Byte-le. The README document is attached to this page.
Refer to that for additional info to what's here!
